# GeoTemp-Compare

GeoTemp-Compare is a Python-based project that compares the *temperature and elevation* of two cities using their latitude and longitude.

The program allows users to:
- View the comparison in tabular form  
- Visualize elevation using bar graphs  
- Visualize temperature using bar graphs  

This project uses:
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib
- requests 

## How it works
1. The user enters two city names and geocodes 
2. Temperature and elevation are retrieved  
3. Results are displayed in tables and graphs  

## Why this project
This project demonstrates how geography, climate data, and programming can be combined to analyze real-world information.
